            <h1>You solved the case!</h1>
            <p>You crawl to the end of the long, dark tunnel covered in dust and soot. Your paws ache and your heart is pounding
                as you realize you aren't alone. Lit by the glow of a tiny makeshift fire, you see the statue of Bastet sitting
                in a tiny armchair made of matchsticks. It isn't alive or anything weird like that, but it's sitting next to 
                a tiny mouse that is even more afraid than you are.

                "I didn't mean to cause any trouble for you. I just get so lonely here and I don't have anyone, so I thought I'd keep the statue with me."

                You smile to yourself and think about all the previous suspects and scenarios that swirled in your head before.

                Then you respond "I'll visit you every week and we'll have tea. I promise."

                With a huge grin the mouse smiles and lets you take the statue.

                Case closed.
            </p>
